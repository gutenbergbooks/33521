<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE AND HIS WHEELBARROW.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> already told you that
Frankie lived in a pretty cottage,
separated from the road
by a green lawn, which lay in
front of it. On the other side
of the street, the land was much
lower, a little shining brook running<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
through it, and sometimes,
after a rain, there was quite a
pond of water. In winter this
was a pleasant place for Willie
to skate. His mamma liked it,
because she could watch him
from the windows; Willie liked
it, because when his hands were
cold he could run home to warm
himself; and Frankie liked it,
because it made him laugh and
clap his hands to see his brother
bow and turn this way and that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
run a few steps, and then make
such pretty figures on the ice.
He had no doubt at all but Willie
did all this just to amuse him.
If you could have seen him as
he stood in his chair at the front
window, how he jumped up and
down, and threw his head back,
and then held it far forward on
his breast, laughing so merrily,
bursting out afresh every time
Willie made a bow or stretched
out his arms, you could not have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
helped laughing yourself, out of
sympathy.</p>

<p>Sally seemed to enjoy it as
much as he did.</p>

<p>"I declare," she said one day,
as her mistress entered the room
and found her sitting by the fire
with her work, while Frankie
stood at the window, "I haven't
laughed so much in a month.
It does one's heart good just to
see how the little fellow enjoys
his brother's sport."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>Back of the house where he
lived there was a barn. His
papa did not keep a horse in it,
but one day, after some months,
a gentleman came to pass a few
days at the cottage, and his horse
was put up in the barn. One
pleasant evening, when papa, and
mamma, and their friends were
walking in the garden, the gentleman
said he would lead his
horse down to the pond, and
give him some water to drink,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and he invited Willie to ride upon
the horse's back. Willie's papa
helped him on, and he held fast
by the horse's mane. When he
came back, Frankie wanted to
ride too. Mamma was afraid he
would fall; but the gentleman
said the horse was gentle, and
papa said he would hold him
very tightly.</p>

<p>So Frankie mounted the horse,
and took his first lesson in riding.
Papa was going to walk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
about the grounds, but the little
boy said, "Pony want water
gen, papa; pony must have
more water."</p>

<p>Frankie had never been to the
pond before. First they had to
cross the road, then go through
the rail fence into the field. The
gentleman let down two bars, and
the horse carefully stepped over
the other. Then papa held his
baby very tight, because they
were going down a steep place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
into the water. The gentleman
thought pony would not drink
again; but he did, and Frankie
leaned over, and saw him suck
up great mouthfuls of water.
Then they turned back, and went
out of the field, papa holding the
horse, while the gentleman put
up the bars again.</p>

<p>Mamma was very glad to get
her boy safely home. She had
been anxious all the time, for
fear he would fall and hurt himself,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
though papa laughed, and
told her there was no danger.
She had kept Ponto near her,
for fear he would bark and
frighten the strange horse. But
the moment Frankie was taken
off, he flew up to him, and licked
his face and hands, and tried to
spring on his neck, he was so
glad to see him.</p>

<p>I don't know what Frankie
would have done without Ponto.
Willie and Margie were at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
school; and there were a great
many hours when he would have
had to play alone. But Ponto
was always ready for a frolic.
He was never tired or out of
humor, though sometimes he
was rather too rough; and then
he loved his young master so
much, that he wanted to kiss
him oftener than Frankie liked.</p>

<p>Early in the summer, papa
had bought a wheelbarrow for
his boy to roll in the yard. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
was painted red, and on the sides
were pretty pictures painted in
gilt. It had long, smooth handles,
and a large wheel, so that
it ran along the walks very nicely
indeed.</p>

<p>I wish you could have been
there to see what pleasant plays
Frankie had with his dog and
his wheelbarrow; but as you
were not, I will try to tell you
about it.</p>

<p>Mamma had made a pretty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
sun bonnet, with a deep frill to
shade his face, and as soon as
the sun had dried up the dew,
she tied it on his head, and let
him run all about the grounds
with only Ponto to take care
of him.</p>

<p>Ponto knew very well that
the little fellow was left in his
charge; and when mamma said,
"Ponto, look here, sir; take care
of your little master," he would
hold up his head, and wag his tail,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and bow, wow, wow, as much
as to say, "Yes, indeed, ma'am."</p>

<p>Then Frankie would run along
wheeling his barrow, and Ponto
close beside him, until they came
to the woodpile. Here the little
boy stopped, and began to fill his
barrow with sticks; and Ponto
picked them up in his teeth almost
as fast as Frankie did with
his hands. Sometimes he was
wild and full of fun, so that
when Frankie wanted to take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the stick from his mouth and
put it in the barrow, Ponto
would spring up into the air,
and run away; but when he
heard his master say, "Come
here, sir," he would be sober in
a moment. O, Ponto was a very
knowing dog indeed!</p>

<p>When the barrow was full,
Frankie rolled it to the back
door, and put it in a basket set
there for him by Jane. When
she saw him coming, she called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
out through the window, "Sure
and he's not a baby at all, but
a man entirely, to be bringing
me all my wood. Sure and I'll
make him a nice cake for his
supper."</p>

<p>Then Frankie felt very large,
and walked off with his head up
and his lips parted in a pleasant
smile.</p>

<p>By and by Frankie would be
tired of wheeling wood; then he
used to take Jane's small kitchen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
shovel, and fill his barrow with
sand; and what do you think he
did with it. I am sure you
cannot guess. Why, he poured
it all over Ponto. The first time
he did this, the dog did not like
it at all; but when he heard
Frankie laughing so merrily, and
saw how much he was pleased,
he felt, I suppose, willing to submit.
So he lay down again in
the walk, and this time Frankie
laughed so that he did not half<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
fill the barrow before he poured
it over the dog again.</p>

<p>Much as he tried to like it,
I suppose Ponto was not very
much pleased, for he soon got
up and shook himself thoroughly,
and then barked a little, as
if to say, "No more, if you
please."</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE AND HIS DOG.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days after Frankie's
ride on horseback, he was out
of doors playing with Ponto,
and he thought he would take
a walk down to the pond. Before
this time, he had been a
very good boy, and had never
gone through the gate into
the road, though sometimes he
would stand at the fence, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
look through to see people passing
by.</p>

<p>Mamma was busy in the parlor
with company; and Sally was
at work in the back part of the
house.</p>

<p>When Ponto saw that his
master was going into the street,
he began to bark furiously, for
he knew this was not exactly
right. Mrs. Gray heard him,
and ran to the window; but
just at this moment Frankie was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
behind a tree, and she did not
see him; so she thought that the
dog was barking at something he
saw in the road.</p>

<p>For a minute Ponto was very
much excited, and ran back toward
the house, but presently
turned and followed Frankie to
the water.</p>

<p>The little boy did not seem at
all afraid, but went right down
the steep path where he had
rode on the horse. I suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
he thought the water looked very
pretty, for he walked right into
it up to his waist.</p>

<p>A few minutes after Frankie
went away from the back door,
Sally went out to shake the
hearth rug. As she did not see
him any where about, she called,
"Frankie, Frankie! Ponto, Ponto!"
She ran around to the
front of the house, still calling,
"Frankie, Frankie!" and "Ponto,
Ponto!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Mamma heard her, and ran to
the door.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Frankie,
ma'am?" asked Sally, pale with
fright.</p>

<p>"Where's Ponto?" cried the
lady, without stopping to answer.</p>

<p>"There he is," screamed nurse,
running as fast as she could
toward the water.</p>

<p>Mamma ran too, and the ladies
who were in the parlor; but
mamma was so frightened that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
her head swam round and round,
and she could hardly stand.</p>

<p>When Ponto heard them
coming, he barked louder than
ever, but he did not run toward
them; and Sally sprang over the
fence without waiting to let the
bars down, and in one moment
more caught the poor frightened
Frankie in her arms. Ponto
had taken the little fellow in his
teeth, and put him on the bank.</p>

<p>He lay quite still, as if he were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
very tired, only when Sally placed
him in his mamma's arms, he
put up his little wet hand, and
tried to stroke her cheek. His
eyes were very red, as if he had
been crying, and his clothes all
dripping with water and stained
with mud. Sally ran forward to
get the bath tub filled with
warm water, while mamma carried
him gently toward the house.</p>

<p>No one seemed to be in such
good spirits as Ponto. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
danced and jumped, trying to
catch Frankie's foot, and whisked
his tail up and down, and did
every thing he could to express
his joy at having his little friend
safe again.</p>

<p>How and when the ladies
went away mamma did not
know. She carried her dear
boy up into the nursery, and
then sank down, and began to
cry. When Sally saw her, she
cried too; and Jane, who, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
pulling off Frankie's stockings,
wiped her eyes with her apron.
They were all crying for joy that
dear, darling little Frankie had
not been drowned. And mamma
whispered a few words as she
bent over her boy. She knew
that God could hear, and so she
said, "O my heavenly Father,
I do thank thee for restoring
my precious child to my arms.
Once more I give him to thee."</p>

<p>While she was washing him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
she told Sally that she had heard
Ponto bark some time before, but
could not see that Frankie was
with him. "I shall always love
Ponto," she said, "for he saved
my boy."</p>

<p>Ponto was lying on the hearth
rug, resting himself. He had had
a great deal to do that morning,
and he had done it well. Now,
when he heard mamma repeat
his name, he rapped with his tail
on the floor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good fellow!" said mamma;
"good Ponto!"</p>

<p>He rapped again, louder than
before. This was the way he
meant to say, "I am as glad
as you are, that dear Frankie
is safe."</p>

<p>When the little fellow had
been dressed in his clean clothes,
Sally said she would run down
to the water and bring up his
wheelbarrow, which she saw
there. Jane went with her, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
they found where he went in,
for his tiny shoe was sticking
fast in the mud. Then they
went round to the other side,
where Ponto had carried him,
and found it was very deep
water, so that if the noble dog
had not taken him out, he must
have been drowned.</p>

<p>When Willie came home from
school, and heard what a trusty
friend Ponto had been, he put
his arms round the dog's neck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and kissed him. Frankie had
kissed him very often, but Willie
had never done so before. But
Ponto seemed to understand it
very well; and when papa came
in, all the while mamma was telling
him about poor Frankie's accident,
he stood gazing into her face.</p>

<p>For a few moments papa could
not speak; his heart was too full.
He walked away to the window
and wiped his eyes; but presently
he came back, and patted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Ponto on the head, and said,
"Noble Ponto! good fellow!"</p>

<p>Then Ponto knew that he was
glad too; and he went to the bed
where Frankie was lying, and
putting up his fore paws, began
to lick the little fellow's hand.</p>

<p>When Sally took up the wet
clothes to carry them to the
wash, there were the marks of
Ponto's teeth, where he had fastened
them firmly through the
dress, cambric and flannel skirts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE IN TRIAL.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> told you so much about
Frankie, I suppose you will want
to know whether he was always
a good boy. Did he never show
a naughty temper? Was he
never unkind to his brother
Willie? or to his little nurse
Margie? Did he never tell a
lie? never take what was not
his own? I am sorry to say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
that he did some of these things,
and no doubt would have done
a great many more, but that he
had a kind mamma and papa to
teach him.</p>

<p>One of the greatest blessings
which God can give a little boy
or a little girl, is a good Christian
mother. I hope, my dear
young friend, if God has been
so kind as to give you such a
mother, that you will thank him
every day of your life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>When you wake up in the
morning and repeat your little
hymn, thanking God for letting
you see another day, with the
pleasant sun and sweet-smelling
flowers, don't forget to thank
him, too, for giving you a dear
mamma to love you and watch
over you.</p>

<p>And then, when you are tired
with play, and lie down at night
to rest your head upon the soft
pillow, don't go to sleep without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
thanking him for preserving her
who has prepared you nice food,
made you warm clothes, and tried
to lead your little feet in the path
of right.</p>

<p>I think whatever faults little
Frankie had, he dearly loved his
mother. Ever so many times in
a day he would run to her side,
sometimes right in the midst of
his play, and say, "I want to kiss
oo. I love oo."</p>

<p>When he meddled with her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
work-basket, or did other troublesome
things, and she spoke
sharply, "Frankie, don't do so,"
he would turn in a moment and
ask, with a quivering lip, "Am I
your darling now, mamma?"</p>

<p>Once in a while Frankie would
get up in the morning, and instead
of the bright smile he generally
wore, his face looked cross.
Nurse used to say he got out of
bed the wrong way. When this
was the case, nothing seemed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
go right with him. At breakfast
he pushed away his plate,
and would not let Margie fasten
on his bib, and seemed very unhappy.
This was not because
he was sick, but because he was
out of humor, and needed to be
brought right again.</p>

<p>His mamma was very much
troubled about it, and she said
to herself, "If I do not correct
my little son, he will grow more
unhappy, and his temper will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
become so sullen that no one
will love him; and what is worst
of all, God will not love him."
She went away alone into her
chamber, and knelt down by her
bed, and asked God to direct her
what to do in order to make
Frankie a good boy.</p>

<p>I suppose God did put some
good thoughts into her mind, for
the next day, when the little boy
was naughty again, she arose
at once, and led him away to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
chamber, and talked with him
a long time. And then they
knelt down together, and she
held his little hands while she
asked God to take away his
wicked heart, and give him a
good one, that would be full of
pleasant, happy thoughts, and of
love to the dear Saviour and to
every body.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to
know one thing she told him.
It was this. She said, "My dear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Frankie, when you look so cross,
and speak unkindly to Willie,
and do not wish to obey me, do
you know who is close by you,
whispering in your ear?"</p>

<p>"No, mamma," said Frankie;
"I didn't see any body."</p>

<p>"It is the wicked Satan," said
mamma. "He likes to see you
naughty, and so he puts unkind
thoughts into your heart. He
would like to have you naughty
all the time, because then he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
knows you could not be happy.
He don't like good children, and
he can't bear to stay where they
are; so he has to run off by himself
when you are obedient, and
kind, and happy. Shall I tell
you what I think he was whispering
in your ear this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma."</p>

<p>"Well, when you rubbed out
Willie's figures, after he asked
you not to do so, I think he said,
'I wouldn't mind my brother;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
I'd do it just to vex him.' Then,
when I forbade you to touch it
again, he whispered, 'Get away,
mamma; I don't love you this
morning.'"</p>

<p>Frankie hung down his head,
and looked very sober. He did
not like to think he had been
pleasing Satan, but still he was
troubled, for he did not know
exactly what to do. In a minute
he said, "I will try to be
good Frankie, mamma."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is right, my darling.
If you try to be good, and when
you hear Satan tempting you to
do such wicked things, tell him at
once to go away, then the good
Spirit will come and help you to
be kind, and to do every thing
that is right. If you had not been
listening to Satan this morning,
you could have heard him, though
he talks very softly indeed."</p>

<p>"What did he say, mamma?"
asked Frankie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose he was saying,
'Willie is a very kind brother,
and loves you dearly. I wouldn't
trouble him, my dear;' and then
when I spoke, perhaps he said,
'Your mother knows what is
right, little boy. She does it for
your good, for she wants you to
be happy.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S BLOCK HOUSE.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days after mamma
talked with Frankie, he was building
a high house on the floor with
his blocks, when Sally passed
along and hit them, and over
they went. The little boy looked
very angry. "You naughty girl,"
he said.</p>

<p>Mamma laid down her work,
and gazed at him, and her eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
looked very sorry. As soon as
Sally went out of the room, she
said, "What is Satan whispering
to you now, my dear?"</p>

<p>Frankie started up and looked
behind him: "I don't see him
any where," he said.</p>

<p>"But didn't you hear his
voice?" asked mamma.</p>

<p>"Yes, I did: he said, 'Throw
a block at nurse; she is so
naughty to knock your house
over.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall I blow Satan away?"
said mamma.</p>

<p>"Yes, please."</p>

<p>She blew very hard; then
opened the door, and blew again,
as if she meant to send him off.
"Now he's gone, I think," she said,
looking in Frankie's bright face.</p>

<p>"The next time he comes I'll
whip him, mamma," cried the little
fellow, standing very straight,
"'cause he tells me naughty
things."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few minutes Sally came
in again, and glanced at the little
boy to see whether he felt happier
than he did before.</p>

<p>Frankie looked at her, too, and
his mamma thought he seemed
sorry that he had called her
naughty. She called him to her,
and whispered, "Is any body
speaking to you now, my darling?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma. It says, 'Tell
Sally you're sorry.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you going to mind the
good Spirit?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mamma. I'm sorry,
nurse, I called you naughty."</p>

<p>Nurse looked very much
pleased. "I am sorry myself,
dear," she said, "that my dress
hit your blocks; and, if mamma
is willing, I'll build you a high
house."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," said mamma.</p>

<p>So Sally sat down on the carpet,
and Frankie passed her the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
blocks; and she built a meeting
house, with a high steeple.
Mamma thought it was splendid,
and the little boy danced about,
and put his arms round Sally's
neck, and kissed her ever so many
times. "I'm so happy, mamma,"
he said, when she had gone.</p>

<p>"Children are always happy,
my dear," she said, "when they
have tried to be good."</p>

<p>"Satan can't stay here now;
can he, mamma?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, he has gone to trouble
some other little boy with
naughty thoughts."</p>

<p>The next morning, Frankie
had forgotten all about this;
and when papa said he must
not have so much sugar on his
cakes, his lips began to pout,
and they were all afraid he was
going to be very naughty.</p>

<p>Mamma leaned over her plate,
and said, softly, "Is Satan here
again?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, mamma," said Frankie;
"may I whip him out?"</p>

<p>She nodded yes; and he then
jumped down from the table, and
began to blow with all his might.
Then he caught up a newspaper,
and whisked it all about, saying,
"Go long, old feller; go long out
of this house."</p>

<p>"Whew! whew!" said papa;
"what is all this?"</p>

<p>Mamma smiled, as if she understood
it well; and presently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the little fellow climbed up in
his chair, looking very bright
and happy, but quite out of
breath with his exercise.</p>

<p>"Satan's gone, papa," he said.
"Now I'm your dear little
Frankie."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, you are," said
his father, laughing heartily. "I
am glad we have found a way to
get rid of Satan so easily."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" asked
Willie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will tell you presently, my
dear," said papa.</p>

<p>When they had done breakfast,
Mr. Gray opened the Bible
for prayers, and taking Frankie
on his knee, and calling Willie
to stand by his side, he said,
"In God's book, he tells us that
Satan is our great enemy, who
is trying to make us do wrong.
He is called a roaring lion, who
goeth about seeking whom he
may devour. This means that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
he loves to destroy our happiness,
and to see people miserable;
and he knows if we are
naughty, we shall suffer. He
goes about whispering in the
ears of little boys and girls,
prompting them to mischief, persuading
them to tell lies, to be
disobedient and unkind. If children
listen to his voice, they soon
become like him; but if they say,
'Get thee behind me, Satan,' or
drive him away, as Frankie did,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the Holy Spirit will come and
put good thoughts into their
minds, and teach them, as the
Bible says, what they ought to
say and what they ought to do."</p>

<p>Papa then knelt down, and
holding Frankie's little hand,
prayed that he might always
listen to the voice of the good
Spirit, and be led by it to do all
that is right.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE AND THE SUGAR.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> morning Mrs. Gray was
finishing a piece of work which
she wished to send away, when
Frankie ran in from the dining
hall, and asked, "Mamma, may
I have some chucher?" He
meant sugar, but he could not
speak the word plainly.</p>

<p>"Where is the sugar that you
want, my dear?" asked mamma.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the table," said Frankie.
"Nurse is washing the dishes."</p>

<p>"Look in my face, darling,"
said mamma, "Did you take
any sugar without my leave?"</p>

<p>Frankie looked up with his
clear, truthful eyes, and said, "No,
mamma, I didn't take any."</p>

<p>"Then go and get two large
lumps, and bring them to me."</p>

<p>The little boy ran off, saying, "I
will, mamma; I will get some."</p>

<p>Presently he returned with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
them; and she said, "Now, my
dear, you shall have these, because
you didn't take any without
asking leave."</p>

<p>A few months before this time,
Willie one day found Frankie in
the store closet dipping up sugar
with his hand from the barrel,
and crowding it into his mouth.
His whole face was covered with
sugar, when Willie lifted him
down from the chair, and led
him to his mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>When mamma had washed
his hands and face, she took
him in her lap, and told him it
was very naughty to take mother's
sugar without her permission.
When he wanted sugar,
or candy, or figs, he must always
ask for them. Since that time
she had not known him to touch
any thing until he had first asked
leave. Once she had left a paper
of cough candy in her drawer
for several days, and she knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
he often went to this drawer on
errands for her. She was coughing
severely one afternoon, and
said, "I really wish I had some
candy."</p>

<p>"I will get you some," he said.
"I saw some in the drawer;" and
away he ran for it.</p>

<p>Mamma was so much pleased
that he had not taken any, that
she gave him a small paper of
sugar plums. The cough candy
was not good for him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Ever since Frankie could remember,
his mamma had told
him the pretty stories in the
Bible. The account of Adam
and Eve in the garden; the sad
death of good Abel, and the punishment
of wicked Cain; the ark,
and the dreadful flood; the stories
of Joseph and his brethren,
of Samuel and of Ruth, were as
familiar to him as the names of
the family circle. Indeed, the
little boy seemed to connect the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
events of the Bible with every
thing he saw.</p>

<p>One day a gentleman gave
him a short cane. He had often
seen Frankie play horse with his
father's cane, and he thought it
would please the child to have
one of his own.</p>

<p>Frankie was very much delighted,
and ran around the garden
with it for several hours,
Ponto following close at his
heels, quite delighted with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
new sport. At last he came in,
and, sitting down by his mamma,
began to play with the string
she had tied around the head of
the cane. Then he looked very
thoughtful for a minute, when he
said, "I don't like that cane any
more."</p>

<p>"Why don't you like it?" she
asked, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Because it killed good Abel,
you know."</p>

<p>"O, no," said mamma, with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
laugh. "That Cain was a man,
and not a stick."</p>

<p>The little fellow was once playing
out near the barn, when he
fell and cut his finger against a
piece of glass. It bled very
freely, so that mamma could not
bind it up. She told Sally to
bring a bowl of water, and held
his poor finger in it. The water
was soon red with the blood;
and Frankie cried louder than
ever. All at once he stopped,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and said, "Mamma, it seems like
the Red Sea. How could the
Israelites get through so much
blood?"</p>

<p>"That was not red with blood,
my dear," said mamma. "It was
only the name of the sea. There
are the Red Sea, and the Black
Sea, and the White Sea."</p>

<p>Frankie was very fond of cake,
and would have liked to make
his whole supper of it. But
mamma knew it would make him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
sick. Sometimes, when he was
in the kitchen, Jane gave him
a piece; and one day his mother
was very much pleased when he
came running to her with a rich
cake in his hand, fresh from the
oven. "May I eat it, mamma?"
he asked. "I didn't taste it
without your leave."</p>

<p>Mamma broke off a small
piece, and gave it to him, and
then took him in her lap, and
repeated a pretty little hymn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
she had learned when she was
a child. I think you will like to
hear it too.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>FRANKIE'S ROCKING HORSE.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Frankie was between
three and four years old, there
were a good many words he
could not pronounce distinctly.
He could not say kitchen, but
called it chichen; and he called
sugar chucher. He could not
say sing, but said ting. His
papa was afraid he never would
be able to pronounce them; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
he took a great deal of pains to
have him try to say them over
and over again. He used to
take Frankie on his knee, and
make him sound s-s-, and then
say s-sing. But Frankie always
said s-ting.</p>

<p>One day his mamma was passing
through the back hall, and
she saw her little boy kneeling
in a chair by the table where
Jane was making bread. He
was talking very earnestly, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
she stopped a moment to hear
what he was saying.</p>

<p>He was giving Jane a lesson.
"Now say knife," he began. So
Jane said "knife."</p>

<p>"No, that not wight; you
must say s- knife."</p>

<p>Jane laughed: "knife is right,"
she said.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he repeated; "papa
say s- knife; so you must say it
wight."</p>

<p>He thought it was as well to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
put s- on any other word as on
sing.</p>

<p>He was very fond of playing
school, and was quite happy when
Willie and Margie would be his
scholars. Dinah was always set
up in her chair too, and another
dolly whose name was Lily
Gray. Frankie would set them
all before him, and then ask,
"Margie, who first man?"</p>

<p>"Adam."</p>

<p>"Now, you good girl, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
may go wight to your seat.
Willie, who first boy?"</p>

<p>"Cain."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's wight; now you
be vely till, cause I shall peach."
Then he would stand in his chair
and preach very loud, spreading
his arms, and always closing
with a long amen.</p>

<p>Once, when he was kneeling
with his father, he thought the
prayer rather long, and putting
up his face, he whispered, "Say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
amen, papa;&mdash;can't you say
amen?"</p>

<p>Frankie was very happy one
day when his mamma told him
that his aunt and cousin were
coming to make them a visit.
He packed all his playthings in
a trunk, to have them ready for
the little baby, and then went
round the house telling every
body that Eddie was coming to
see him.</p>

<p>The day before they were expected,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
a beautiful present came
for Frankie from Mr. Wallace,
the same kind gentleman who
had given him the silver cup.</p>

<p>Can you guess what it was?
It was not a cup and ball, nor
a top, nor an iron hoop, but a
rocking horse with a carriage
fastened to it large enough for
him to get in it. Then there
was a place for the whip, and
two pairs of reins for him to
drive with.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>At first, Frankie stood looking
at it, his eyes growing larger and
larger, until papa asked, "Well,
Frankie, how do you like your
new horse?"</p>

<p>"Is it for me, papa, for mine
own telf?" exclaimed the little
boy, clapping his hands and
dancing up and down. "O,
I'm to glad!" Then raising his
eyes, he said, soberly, "Tank
you, Dod. Tank you vely much
indeed."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>His mamma had taught him
that all our blessings come from
God; and the dear boy wished
to thank him for this new favor.</p>

<p>I can hardly tell you how
much pleased he was with his
present. He could scarcely stop
riding to eat his dinner; and
then had to put up the horse
in the corner of the room he
called the stable, and tie him
very tightly to a chair, for fear
he would run away. Then, before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
his mother noticed what he
was about, he slipped from his
seat, and carried his silver cup
of water to the pony, and held
it to his mouth to drink.</p>

<p>"Pony hungry," he said, when
she called him back. "Pony
vely hungry indeed."</p>

<p>When Willie and Margie came
from school, mamma watched her
boy, to see whether he would
be generous, and allow them to
share in his rides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"O, my!" called out Willie,
"how pretty it is! Let me
get in."</p>

<p>"Yet, you may," said Frankie,
stepping out of the carriage.
"Here, take Dinah too. Dinah
wants to wide."</p>

<p>While Willie was whipping the
horse to make him go as fast as
he could, Frankie danced up and
down, every now and then calling
out, "Go long, pony, go long!"</p>

<p>In the mean time, Margie stood<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
awaiting her turn, hardly daring
to expect that Frankie would
give up his new plaything to
her. Mamma was looking on
too, and was very happy when
he said, "There, Willie, you must
get out now, cause Margie wants
to wide. Top a minute, Margie;
I'll fix the reins for you," he
cried; and he went to the pony's
head, and patted him, and said,
"Whoa, sir, whoa!" just like
any gentleman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day, when Eddie and
his mamma came, Frankie seemed
very happy to share his pleasure
with his little cousin. They rode
away together to visit other papas
and mammas, but always
came back at last to the stable
in the corner of the room.</p>

<p>Can you tell what it was made
Mrs. Gray so happy, when she
looked at the pretty pony? It
was because her darling boy had
not been selfish with it, and tried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to keep it all to himself, but had
liked to see others riding in it,
and enjoying it too. When little
boys or girls are generous
and kind, then look for smiles
and kisses from their mammas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<div class='chaptertitle'>THE TRY COMPANY.</div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">O mamma!</span>" cried Willie, one
day, running home from school
in great haste, "the boys are
going to have a little company;
may I have a soldier cap and
belong to it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray sat busily at work,
but she at once laid down her
sewing in her lap, and thought a
moment, and then she said, "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
want you to belong to my company,
my dear!"</p>

<p>"What company, mamma?
Will they wear soldier caps, and
jackets with red all down here,
and stripes on their pantaloons?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they will be all dressed
up with plumes and stars on
their shoulders. It will be called
the Try Company."</p>

<p>"May I have a cap too?"
asked Frankie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, any little boy may join
who will agree to the rules."</p>

<p>"Rules, mamma," said Willie,
"Do companies have rules?"</p>

<p>"O, yes, my dear! Soldiers
always have to obey the captain;
and if an enemy comes,
to go and fight him."</p>

<p>"Shall we fight, then?" asked
the boy in surprise.</p>

<p>"There will be one kind of
fighting, my dear; but it will
not be fighting with swords.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
You may ask all the little boys,
who wish to form a company,
up here after school this evening,
and I will talk with them. Perhaps
they will like to join my
company."</p>

<p>Willie laughed quite heartily.
"Yours, mamma! Shall you be
the captain?"</p>

<p>"If they choose me I shall,
my dear."</p>

<p>As soon as Willie had gone to
school, Mrs. Gray began to cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
long strips of colored paper and
wind them into plumes. There
was a very long waving one of
yellow for the captain, and one
of blue for the lieutenant, and
twelve of pink for the soldiers.
She did not think there would
be more than fourteen at first.
Then she cut sheets of paper,
and taught Sally to form them
into caps; and after they were
done, she sewed the plumes on,
and laid them all out on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
table, which stood in the hall, so
as to attract the notice of the boys
when they came in from school.</p>

<p>Next she sent Sally to the
attic for some strips of red and
blue cloth. Of the red she made
pretty stars to fasten on the
shoulders, while nurse cut long
smooth stripes to trim their
jackets and pantaloons.</p>

<p>They had but just finished their
work when a shout from Willie
called mamma to the door, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
she saw a company of boys
awaiting her orders.</p>

<p>"Come in," she said, smiling
at their bright, expectant faces;
"come in, and we will form the
company."</p>

<p>As they entered the hall they
stopped short at sight of the
beautifully plumed caps. "O
mamma!" was all that Willie
could say.</p>

<p>She led them into the dining
hall, and then told them her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
plan. "I want to form a company
of boys," she began. "It
will be called the 'Try Company,'
because every one belonging to
it must learn to try to do things
for himself. But first of all I
must tell you the rules. No
little boy can join my company
unless he will promise not to
use one naughty or vulgar word,
not to tell a lie, and not to be
unkind. If he has ever told lies,
he must try to do so no more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Next he must try in his lessons.
Sometimes the words are very
long, and boys say, 'I can't learn
them;' but my company will
never say so.</p>

<p>"My boys will say, 'I'll try.'
If the geography lesson is difficult,
and you can't readily find
the places on the maps, you will
think of your pretty plumes, and
say, 'I won't give up; I'll try
again.'</p>

<p>"Then, when the sum is long,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and it makes your head ache to
add up four and ten and two
and five, you won't mind that,
but keep on trying until you
succeed."</p>

<p>"Mother wants to know if my
little brother can't join your
company," asked a dear boy
whose name was James; "but
he don't learn sums; he is too
small."</p>

<p>"O, yes, indeed!" said mamma;
"Frankie has a cap like the rest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and your brother shall have one
too, and a star on his shoulder."</p>

<p>"May I carry my drum?"
eagerly asked Willie.</p>

<p>"Certainly, my dear; but wait
a little. I have not told all the
rules yet. My company must
try, too, when they are at play.
If James throws a ball, and hits
John, he must <i>try</i> not to do so
again. And if John feels a little
angry, and thinks it very hard
for James to hurt him, he must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<i>try</i> to put all these naughty
thoughts away, and call it an
accident, and say 'I don't believe
he meant to do it.' Then, if
James or Willie wants to be
captain, and the company choose
another, James or Willie must
<i>try</i> to be pleased and good humored
about it."</p>

<p>"I thought you were to be
captain, mother," cried Willie.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you would all
laugh," said mamma, "to see me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
marching round at the head of
such a troop of boys."</p>

<p>"We would <i>try</i> not to," exclaimed
Willie, laughing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray laughed too; and
then she said, "I want to see
whether you understand about
my rules; so I shall ask you a
few questions. I once saw a
boy sawing a stick of wood. It
was a very large stick, and the
saw went hard; the little fellow
sat down and looked at it. 'It's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
too large,' said he; 'I can't get
through it. I may as well give up
first as last.' But presently he
said, 'I'll try once more though;'
and he started up, and sawed
away, up and down, up and
down, until the stick fell in two.
Then the boy laughed and wiped
his forehead, which was quite
wet with perspiration, and said,
'There, I'm right glad I tried
again. I never should have done
it without trying.' Now tell me,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
could that little fellow be admitted
into the Try Company?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, O, yes, ma'am!"
answered all the boys.</p>

<p>"He ought to be the captain,"
said one.</p>

<p>Willie blushed, and held down
his head.</p>

<p>"I knew another boy, who was
winding some silk for his mother,"
said the lady. "He jerked
it so much that it snarled badly.
He pulled it, and twitched it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and made it worse than ever;
and then he said; 'I can't do
any thing with it.' When his
mother came back for the silk,
there it was upon the chair, so
tangled up that she could not
use it."</p>

<p>"He can't belong," called out
the boys.</p>

<p>"I think you understand quite
enough to form the company,"
said mamma. "Now I will put
the vote. Would you all like to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
form a Try Company? If you
would, you may hold up your
hands."</p>

<p>Every small hand was quickly
raised.</p>

<p>"And you promise to <i>try</i>, according
to the rules?" said the
lady.</p>

<p>Each little hand was raised
again.</p>

<p>"Who is the oldest boy?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Sammy Lanman, ma'am."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I advise you to let
Sammy be the captain the first
time, and then each of you take
turns, until it comes down to little
Frankie."</p>

<p>"May I run home for my
brother?" asked James.</p>

<p>The lady stopped a moment
to count the boys, and finding
there were only twelve with
Frankie, and that there would
be caps enough for all, she
said yes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>While he was gone, Willie
ran to his play room for his
drum, and Mrs. Gray dressed
the Try Company in their new
uniform, which did indeed look
very fine. Then James came
leading his little brother Walter;
and when they were all
dressed, their captain arranged
them in order, and they then
marched off down the yard,
into the road, looking as happy
as you please. Mamma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and nurse stood at the door
gazing after them, while Jane
and Margie stood in the walk,
shading their eyes and laughing
heartily.</p>

<p>Poor Sammy, indeed, found
that the office of captain was a
most responsible one. His face
grew very red as he perceived
the younger members marching
out of line, and a sharp word of
rebuke rose to his lips, as little
Frankie laughed aloud in his glee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>But suddenly he remembered
that he had promised not to
speak unkindly, and his heart
beat fast as he said to himself,
"Any body will know such little
boys can't train very well the
first time. At any rate, I'll try
to keep my temper."</p>
